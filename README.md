# Google Cloud Computing Foundations
The Google Cloud Computing Foundations course will provide individuals with little to no background or experience in cloud computing a detailed overview of concepts covering cloud basics, big data, and machine learning and where and how Google Cloud fits in. The course starts with an overview of cloud computing and dives deeper into two areas - cloud computing infrastructure, and big data and machine learning. By the end of the course, learners will be able to articulate concepts around cloud computing, big data, and machine learning and demonstrate some hands-on skills.
